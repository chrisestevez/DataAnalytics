## Assignment SQL and R 

Choose six recent popular movies.  Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates, imaginary friends) to rate each of these movie that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5.  Take the results (observations) and store them in a SQL database.  Load the information into an R dataframe. 

## Database creation

I first created a MySQL database containing 3 tables.

* User table
* Movies tables
* Transaction/fact table

```{r cars}
 

summary(cars)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
